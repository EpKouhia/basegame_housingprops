# Preloaded props
 Resource contains ytyps generated for certain props to be enforced preload before entering nearby the MLO it is connected to. This will allow props to be used in scripting without issues loading the models. Ill not be providing a full list of props added to the ytyps due it's mostly containing props used by some housing resources like qb-houses or ps-housing. Full list of the props can be found from those resource configurations. Ill not be providing any additional support for this resource either.

# Disclaimer
If you have a lot streamed assets on your servers you might end up with issues exceeding the archetype limit of 65k. If you start to have issues where your LOD/SLODS stop working. Streaming these YTYPs might not work for everyone. Better option for this would be only generating ytyp for only those props what you need in your housing resource.
